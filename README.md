### About Me

- Iâ€™m a **software developer** seeking an internship, focused on solving real problems with code.
- I enjoy **working with databases** and backend systems. Frontend is okay, but not too much. I'm not a designer.
- My interest in **Artificial Intelligence** led me to start learning Python. I care about building software that uses AI, not just using it as a tool.
- I work across **multiple languages and technologies** and am always open to learning whatever is needed to get the job done.
